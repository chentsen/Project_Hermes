        <div class="cms-text"><p>We've always felt that making friends (both online and offline) is a tricky task. In real life, it's hard to find people you genuinely connect with. You'd have to make a real effort to socialize and go out in order to even get a shot at these connections. 
    </p><br/>
    <p>With the internet, it's relatively easier to find people who share your interests. But what happens after you find someone? You communicate through IM a couple of times and maybe meet up after a few months if you're lucky. Online meetings come with so many barriers: people are wary of strangers, you'll have conflicting schedules, and you're often restricted by your locations.
        </p><br/>
        <p>
We believe that by streamlining the whole process, from finding someone to meeting up with them, we can make it easier for you to create new friendships. Â With PlumeType, it's a simple matter of listing your interests, finding events, and going out and having fun.
