    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We've always felt that making friends (both online and offline) is a tricky task. In real life, it's hard to find people you genuinely connect with. You'd have to make a real effort to socialize and go out in order to even get a shot at these connections. 
    </p><br/>
    <p>With the internet, it's relatively easier to find people who share your interests. But what happens after you find someone? You communicate through IM a couple of times and maybe meet up after a few months if you're lucky. Online meetings come with so many barriers: people are wary of strangers, you'll have conflicting schedules, and you're often restricted by your locations.
        </p><br/>
        <p>
We believe that by streamlining the whole process, from finding someone to meeting up with them, we can make it easier for you to create new friendships. Â With PlumeType, it only takes 3 steps:
        </p><br/>
        <ol><li>1) List your interests</li>
            <li>2) Find events around you based on your interests</li>
            <li>3) Go to these events and meet cool people</li>
        </ol><br/>
<p>Interest-based tags help narrow down your search criteria, while meetups centered around group events create a more comfortable atmosphere for people to make friends and have fun. These are the two core features that make PlumeType work.</p>
